<!-- position   going to div position fixed: stay there
 CSS position 속성은 문서 상에 요소를 배치하는 방법을 지정합니다. 
 position: static means where the layout puts done
 
 position relative : element가 처음으로 위치한 곳을 기준으로 수정
 based on where it has started, so where it has started and -10
 important starting point, from starting point and to the top, bottom, left and right
 
 position absolute, box goes to the right, left, top, bottom to the BODY, not the Parent Box
 because of the main rule of position absolute
 
 Rule of the Position Absolute 
 div try to find "relative" parents, in this case class="green"'s parents is NOT relative, so
 is to BODY 
 fixed, relative, absolute, default:static
 most important is absolute and relative 
 
 NB!!
 many make mistake, the box is absolute and the parent is not relative, then tha standard becomes
 to the body! -->
